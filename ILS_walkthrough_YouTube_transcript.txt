Hello, this is a tutorial on how to use the Interactive Lecture System, or I-L-S, for embedding quizzes into pre-existing videos.
<#0.5#>

In this tutorial, I discuss how to embed quizzes into YouTube videos. Note that the I-L-S can ALSO be used to embed quizzes into videos you have stored locally, or on a remote server.

<#0.5#>
Please open the quiz generator H-T-M-L file that has been provided to you. 

<#0.5#>
This will lead you to the main interface for the I-L-S. 

<#0.5#>
First, click on the radio button beside the option called YouTube U-R-L. Then, copy and paste the link of a publicly accessible YouTube video into the input field below.

<#1.5#>
Next, lets speak about the Upload Eye-Dee button. You can use this option in case you wish to restrict access to your lecture. 

<#0.5#>
Clicking on this will open up your File Explorer window. Here, you can select a text file containing the list of identifiers that you want to include. These can include combinations of letters and numbers. 

<#0.5#>
Here, you see a sample eye-dee file that I will upload. 

<#0.5#>
Once you upload the text file, you will see that the display has updated to let you know how many valid values have been uploaded. This feature is optional but recommended if you want to restrict access to the lecture. 

<#0.5#>
Note that you can also ask your participants to enter their identifying information within the generated video. 

<#0.5#>
The next option, called Save Results to Server, can be skipped for now. This is useful when you want to send the completed quiz data to a remote server, which would require some additional setup. When this option is unchecked, as right now, then the quiz results will be downloaded locally via the browser. You can keep this as is, if you plan on administering your quiz locally.

<#0.5#>
Next, enter the number of quizzes you wish to administer over the lecture. For this example, we will create two quizzes. Enter the number two, beside the "Number of Quizzes" label, and press Generate Quiz Fields

<#1.0#>
This informs the program that you want to embed two quizzes into the video. This can be adapted to any number of quizzes that are needed.

<#0.5#>
The first feature to note is the Time Stamp. This tells the program exactly at which point in the video you wish to administer this quiz. 

<#0.5#>
Lets return to the YouTube video. Suppose I want to incorporate the first quiz at this time point in the video. Lets make a note of the time in seconds, then return to the quiz generator interface.

<#0.5#>
I enter the timestamp here in seconds.

<#0.5#>
Then, you can enter the title and description, which is what the user sees. For now, lets keep this simple and type in Q1 inside both fields. However, this can be customized in accordance with your needs. For example, you could type in Demographics if you wanted to embed the demographic questions at this time point. 

<#0.5#>
Next, under Present Items, we can keep the option set to ALL. This tells the application to present all the questions we entered into the quiz. This can be altered to present only subsets of questions, which is an advanced feature that we will not be discussing in this video. 

<#0.5#>
Under the Time Limit, you can enter the duration participants have to complete the quiz. Here, one hundred and eighty seconds is the default, which means that participants have 3 minutes to complete the first quiz. Lets change this to five minutes and enter the value of three hundred.

<#0.5#>
Now, we can enter the number of questions we would like the quiz to present. I will place two here for now, then click on the 'Add Questions' button. 

<#1.5#>
You will see that the interface has dynamically expanded to accommodate the number of questions you entered. 

<#0.5#>
There are three types of questions the I-L-S can present. These include multiple choice, short answer questions and true or false statements.  Lets set up a multiple choice item first.

<#1.5#>
We'll type in the question "how many letters are in the word red?".

<#0.5#>
Then, we can select the question type. The default is set to multiple choice, which we can retain.

<#0.5#>
Next, let's enter the options we would like to present. Ensure that your individual options are separated by a comma. Here, we can enter the options two, a comma, three, a comma, and four

<#0.5#>
The correct answer is 'three', which was the second option we had entered. So, under Correct Answer, you can enter the letter 'b'. Finally, you can allocate points to individual questions if you so choose. 

<#1.5#>
Let's move to the next question. This we could state as true or false. Click on the question type, and select the appropriate option.

<#0.5#>
We can now enter the question text. I've included the text "the earth is sausage-shaped". 

<#0.5#>
I can then set the correct option.

<#1.5#>
Now, you lets move to the second quiz. For the time stamp, lets select the twelve minute mark. This can be entered as seven hundred and twenty seconds. 
<#0.5#>
We can keep the title and description fields simple, as before. I am entering Q2 in both cases. Now, for the sake of brevity, I will add one question to this quiz.

<#0.5#>
For this item, we will select the Short Answer question type.

<#0.5#>
With this option, you can set the question text, as before. You can also set minimum and maximum character limits. This is useful if you require text or narrative based responses. Here, I will provide the following question: "write a short haiku about donuts". We will keep the default character lengths as is, since a haiku should not exceed ten thousand characters.

<#1.5#>
Now that our quiz is set up, go to the bottom of the page. Here, you will find an option to save your current test bank. I recommend you to do this so that you do not have to set up this entire quiz from scratch in the future. You will also be able to edit the quiz structure offline using this file. 

<#0.5#>
Enter the name of your test, which I've done so here by typing in my underscore test. 

<#0.5#>
Then, you can press the Export JSON button to download this test file. Please retain this for the reasons noted earlier.

<#0.5#>
Finally, we can generate the quiz. First, go to the input field beside the label "Output Filename Prefix". Here, enter what you want your generated files to be named as. For now, we can keep the default, which is generated underscore video underscore quiz. 

<#0.5#>
Now, click on the Generate Files button.

<#0.5#>
You may see the following messages show up on screen. First, click on the 'Allow' option if asked to confirm the download of multiple files.

<#0.5#>
Then, select 'keep' when prompted to do so. The generated H-T-M-L and Java Script files now contain your embedded quiz. Ensure both generated files are in the same directory. 

<#0.5#>
The frontend your users will see is the H-T-M-L file. You can click on this to access the video.

<#0.5#>
First, you have to enter one of the Eye Dees we had set up earlier. I will enter s one and press okay. Sometimes you may have to enter the identification twice.

<#0.5#>
Here we have our video. We can play it, and skip ahead to see our first quiz.

<#1.5#>
Let us respond to these items, then press the Submit Cue One button.

<#0.5#>

Now the video resumes. We can skip to the end. 

<#1.5#>

Now we have our final question. We can enter some text, and press the submit cue two button.

<#0.5#>

Finally, we can press the 'Submit Final Results' button, and you will see the data download locally within your browser. This file will contain all the responses provided by the user.

<#0.5#>

And that's it! You now know how to administer YouTube videos with embedded quizzes using the I-L-S system.
